# RelationalAI Standalone Run Harnesses
Deterministic and "standalone" run harness for Rel projects. Execution sequences are defined by [TOML][tomlio] configuration files then executed by the run harness using RAI SDK's ([Julia][raisdkjulia] or [Python][raisdkpython]). Harnesses provide logging and command-line options for more control over individual runs. See branches for more information
